## About This Repository

This is my workspace for **DESN 378 Code + Design 2** also known as **Web Design 2** (or in the future, **Web Design + Code 2**) at Eastern Washington University. **The question this course asks:** How should things behave? In DESN 368, I learned how to make things look right. Here, I'm learning how to make things behave right — treating code as a design material with properties, behaviors, and constraints, just like paint, paper, or clay. Throughout the quarter, I'll work with four digital materials: CSS systems, SVG, animation libraries, and generative code — learning how each responds to manipulation and what each makes possible. Unlike courses focused on user research or backend engineering, this one asks: How does it feel? By the end, this repo will become my portfolio.

## Learning Log

Update this section each week with observations, breakthroughs, and questions.
## Week 0: The Set Up 
I learned how to set up a Github page, where I have my portfolio and the other work I have done in class. I have learned more about the foundation of Javascript from the readings and the lecture done in class, like what it can be used for, what kind of functions it has, and what it can't do. I was able to learn basic javascript code such as: learning to log variables, defining variables, and how to use javascript to change features in existing webpages. I used Ai to help me understand the terms and examples of what they looked like so I could correlate an example variable to the work variable. I also used Ai to help me if I was stuck and everything I tried wasn't working. I still need more practice with getting comfortable using javascript. If I worked on it for a while I was able to pick it up but as soon as I took a break I had to relearn what how to use it. 

### Work Completed (Week 0)
​
**Engage**
- [x] Portfolio Audit
​
**Learn**
- [x] Console Explorer
- [x] Codedex Console Fundamentals
​
**Reflect**
- [x] Visual Notes: Variables and Strings
​
**Build**
- [x] The Setup
- [x] The Behavioral Layer 

### Week 1: Systems That Respond​
### What I Learned
<!-- What concepts clicked for you? What was new? -->
The console log and defining variables has clicked for me. I finally understand what variables look like, how to value them, and how they interact with each other to create an output. What was knew was learning how to create the dark/light mode for webpages. ​
​
### What Was Hard
<!-- What frustrated you? What didn't make sense? -->
I am still trying to get used to using Github for everything. I still have some issues with working with Github. ​
​
### How I Used AI
<!-- Did you use Copilot, ChatGPT, etc.? How did it help or not help? -->
I use Copilot to help me with any issues with Github. I also use it to help me learn the code and their functions. I just uploaded screenshots of the code I am struggling with and it does a good job of explaining what I have to do and how to do it. It helps a lot because it compares my currect code to the correct code and it tells me what I am missing to correct my code.​
​
### What's Still Unclear
<!-- What questions do you still have? What needs more practice? -->
I need to keep working through the assignment and working in Github, I do not feel too comfortable working in it yet.

### Work Completed (Week 1)

**Engage**
- [x] VS Code Theme Setup

**Learn**
- [x] Codedex.io Variables

**Practice**
- [x] The Story Teller

**Build**
- [x] Portfolio Migration
- [ ] Portfolio in Figma + Style Tile (in progress)

**Reflect**
- [x] Visual Notes: Week 1---

### Week 2: Remembering Choices
# Learning Log
​
## Week 2
​
### What I Learned
I learned about tokens in design systems and how they are categorized. I learned the structure of the design tokens and what categories certain features fit( colors, size in categories, default is a state, etc). I learned how those catgories fit into larger categories which are the base, modifier, object, and namesapce level. I applied the the onclick feature to create an interactive story that a user can walk through and switch between images when it is clicked.
​​
### What Was Hard
I got behind over the past week and I am still trying to get caught up with the assignments, so I am just struggling to get those assignments turned in.
​
​
### How I Used AI
I use AI when using Github, I use it to help me fix my errors because I am not very confident in using Github yet. I also use AI when I am struggling to understand how  the code works and I need a more in-depth explanation on it. I also use to help me clariy specifics in the assignments.
​
​
### What's Still Unclear
I still have to get used to Github. I understand figma and I enjoy using it more but I struggle more with Gitthub.
​
​
### Work Completed (Week 2)

**Engage**
- [x] VS Code Theme Setup

**Learn**
- [x] Codedex.io Conditionals
- [ ] figma variables

**Practice**
- [x] The Switch

**Build**
- [ ] The Foundation
- [ ] Portfolio in Figma + Style Tile

**Reflect**
- [x] Visual Notes: Week 2---



## Week 3
​
### What I Learned
This week I learned about svgs and how you can create svgs using html code and input the svg directly instead of using an image. I learned how svgs can be scaled and created based off the shape or placement you want to use for them. I also learned how to add a button to my portfolio that switches from light to dark mode when the button is pressed. I learned to use the conditional for the dark/light button.
​
​
### What Was Hard
I have just been trying to get caught up and getting through my assignments. I am working to get the past week finished and make more progress with this weeks work. I still struggle with Github sometimes but I have been using AI to help when I get stuck on an issue with Github.
​
​
### How I Used AI
I am using AI to help me with concepts that I do not understand. I use Claude to help me fix errors that I do not know how to fix. 
​
​
### What's Still Unclear
Now that I have been working on the assignments, it is starting to make the code easier to understand. 
​
### Work Completed (Week 3)

**Design Tokens**
- [ ] variables.css exists
- [ ] Color tokens defined
- [ ] Typography tokens defined
- [ ] Spacing tokens defined
- [ ] Tokens used in CSS (no hardcoded values)

**Deployment**
- [ ] Deployed to GitHub Pages
- [ ] Repository is public


# Learning Log
​
## Week 4
​
### What I Learned
This week I learned about svgs, svg paths, and the anatomy of svgs. The notes I took explained the the svgs and the interactive notes helped me futher understand how svgs worked.
​
​
### What Was Hard
I have been trying to get caught up with my past assignments and trying to keep up with the current assignments.
​
​
### How I Used AI
AI has been helping me with any issues with github or any questions I have when I am stuck coding. ​
​
### What's Still Unclear
Nothing unclear, jsut trying to get throught the assignments.
​
​### Work Completed (Week 3)

**Design Tokens** 
- [x] The Shape // SVG Structure,
- [ ] Figma's Engine
