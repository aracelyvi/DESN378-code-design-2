## About This Repository

This is my workspace for **DESN 378 Code + Design 2** also known as **Web Design 2** (or in the future, **Web Design + Code 2**) at Eastern Washington University. **The question this course asks:** How should things behave? In DESN 368, I learned how to make things look right. Here, I'm learning how to make things behave right — treating code as a design material with properties, behaviors, and constraints, just like paint, paper, or clay. Throughout the quarter, I'll work with four digital materials: CSS systems, SVG, animation libraries, and generative code — learning how each responds to manipulation and what each makes possible. Unlike courses focused on user research or backend engineering, this one asks: How does it feel? By the end, this repo will become my portfolio.

## Learning Log

Update this section each week with observations, breakthroughs, and questions.
## Week 0: The Set Up 
I learned how to set up a Github page, where I have my portfolio and the other work I have done in class. I have learned more about the foundation of Javascript from the readings and the lecture done in class, like what it can be used for, what kind of functions it has, and what it can't do. I was able to learn basic javascript code such as: learning to log variables, defining variables, and how to use javascript to change features in existing webpages. I used Ai to help me understand the terms and examples of what they looked like so I could correlate an example variable to the work variable. I also used Ai to help me if I was stuck and everything I tried wasn't working. I still need more practice with getting comfortable using javascript. If I worked on it for a while I was able to pick it up but as soon as I took a break I had to relearn what how to use it.
