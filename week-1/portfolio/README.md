# Portfolio — Week 1
​
## Project Structure
- `css/` — Stylesheets
- `scripts/` — JavaScript
- `assets/` — Images, fonts, icons, etc.
​
## Changes This Week
- Migrated to standardized structure

Toggle Logic: I used the click to switch the toggle from light to dark. Then I added the data to help create a preference so that the light/dark feature does not change when the page is refreshed.
Design Decisions: I used the cream and the base color for the light mode and the dark blue as the base for the dark mode.
Citations: I used google fonts for the font on the website, I used gemini to help me with any problems I had with the toggle switch, I used Figma to convert the variables to css.
